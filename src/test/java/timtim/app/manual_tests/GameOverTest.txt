Test: check that the gameOver screen appers when its gameOver

Description:
Start the game in Launcher, choose the level you want and press enter
to get to the Start state screen. The GameOver screen should appear if you come in
contact with either flower, mushroom or bunnies twenty times. This should happen on
all levels, but at level 3 there is also possible to enter Game Over when
TimTim falls in the water.

Steps level 1, 2 and 3:
1: Launch game
2: move TimTim using A key for left movement or D key for right movement.
3: move in the direction of a flower, mushroom or bunny
4: make sure you are right next to them, this will make the healthbar decrease.
5: to decrease the health bar again after contact with flower, mushroom or bunny you have
to move away from it and then again come in contact with the same one or a different one.
6: do this 19 times, the healthbar should now look almost black, only one green "life"
remains.
7: the next time (contact number 20) the Game Over screen should appear.

Steps level 3:
1: Launch game
2: move TimTim using A key for left movement or D key for right movement.
3: move TimTim in the direction of water and make him fall into it
4: no matter what the healthbar is, the GameOver screen should appear when TimTim is into
the water.

Result:
After several playthroughs of each level, the Game Over screen appears then entering the water
at level 3 or when TimTim is in contact with flower, mushroom or bunnies 20 times on all levels.
