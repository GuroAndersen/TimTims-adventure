Level 1 :
- TimTim can push the friend forward if he walks into the wolf, 
- if Timtim dies the wolf can be pushed again and there will be a second wolf that cannot be pushed. This happens in an endless scenario.
- Door missing on level 1. 

Level 2 :
- Timtim cannot continue walking onto the first bridge, he has to jump onto it. Error in how object is drawn in tiled ?
- Missing door. 
- Same problem with friend as in level 1. 
- Some of the flowers and mushrooms are too clustered making it impossible to move past. 

level 3: 
- same bug with interaction with friends
- top left bridge is not possible to jump of from, seems like TimTim doesn't land on it 
- dies from one interaction with a flower or mushroom
